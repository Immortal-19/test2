        <p>Introduction: The Search for Truth
Throughout history, humanity has pondered the greatest questions of existence: Why are we here? What is the purpose of life? Does God exist, and if so, how can we know Him? These questions transcend culture, geography, and time. They are embedded within human consciousness, driving us to seek answers that shape our understanding of reality.
The pursuit of truth is not merely an intellectual exercise; it defines how we live our lives. If there is a Creator, then His existence must have profound implications for our purpose and destiny. If He has communicated with us, then His message is the most important knowledge we can seek.
This book aims to present a logical and structured argument that follows a natural progression from the existence of God to the necessity of divine revelation and finally, the criteria for identifying the true revelation. Each step will be based on reason, evidence, and the innate human longing for truth.
